# Co2-emissions-prediction-using-gradient-boosting-ensemble-algorithm
Based on 11 parameters of a vehicle, Co2 emissions are to be predicted, test_size=12.5% and train_size=87.5%, algorithm used is Gradient boosting. In this exercise I've also used One hot encoding on one of the parameter to incorporate it into the train set.
